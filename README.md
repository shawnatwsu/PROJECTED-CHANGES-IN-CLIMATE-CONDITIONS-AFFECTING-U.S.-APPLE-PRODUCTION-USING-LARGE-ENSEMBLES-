# PROJECTED-CHANGES-IN-CLIMATE-CONDITIONS-AFFECTING-U.S.-APPLE-PRODUCTION-USING-LARGE-ENSEMBLES
#This project analyzes 50 ensemble members out of the 100 ensemble members from the Community Earth System Model-Large Ensemble version 2
#To replicate this, you will need to download the data from 1980-2064 for all files using cmip6 and excluding the smbb files

#You will need to concatenate all the files, as I have done since I found it easier and saved memory.
